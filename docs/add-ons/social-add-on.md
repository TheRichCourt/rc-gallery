# Social add-on

The social add-on puts social share icons in the corner of the shadowbox, enabling your visitors to quickly share your page to social networks.

## Get the add-on

The social add-on is available at [therichcourt.com/joomla/gallery-social-addon](https://therichcourt.com/joomla/gallery-social-addon)

## Installation

You can install the add-on in the same way you would install any other Joomla extension. Once installed, it self enables and so all available share icons will be shown.

Note that you must have the latest version of RC Justified Gallery plugin installed **AND** be using the default shadowbox (note that if you have upgraded from an old version of RC Justified Gallery, you may still be using the old default shadowbox and not realise it. You can change this from the settings). If you don’t meet the above criteria, this add-on will install fine, but it won’t run. A notice will appear in the JavaScript console to remind you of this.
Settings

Settings for the social add-on are extremely simple. Just choose the buttons you want to display, and what order they should show in.

> [!NOTE] **A note about images** -
> Please note that the add-on is built not to use the various social network's JavaScript APIs, which can bog down your site and make it run slow. Instead, they use the share URLs for each social network, keeping the page light and fast. The downside to this is that it doesn’t allow specifying which ‘preview image’ the social networks will use. They pick the image, and it may not be the image your user was looking at when they decided to share the page. However, the important thing is that the URL is correct, and they end up on your site, looking at the right picture!
