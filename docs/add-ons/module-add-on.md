# Module add-on

## Introduction

The module add-on allows you to quickly place galleries inside module positions on your site.

## Get the add-on

The module add-on is available at [therichcourt.com/joomla/gallery-module](https://therichcourt.com/joomla/gallery-module)

## Installation

You can install the add-on in the same way you would install any other Joomla extension. Once installed, it self enables and you’re ready to start creating gallery modules.

## Use

Use it just like any other Joomla module. That’s it, there’s not really anything else to say about this one – it just works.
