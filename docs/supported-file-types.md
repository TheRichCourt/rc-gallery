# Supported files

The plugin works with image files with the following image formats and file extensions only:

* `.jpg`
* `.jpeg`
* `.JPG`
* `.JPEG`
* `.png`
* `.PNG`
* `.gif`
* `.GIF`
* `.webp`
* `.WEBP`

> [!NOTE]
> Note that your server will also need to support these image formats. Normally all are installed by default with most hosting providers, but sometimes they miss out webp support. If you're not seeing `webp` images, you'll need to ask your hosting provider to enable webp support for the GD image extension.
