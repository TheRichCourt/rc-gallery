# RC Gallery

RC Gallery is an easy to use, fixed-width gallery plugin for Joomla.

## Justified fixed-width layout

Just like you can do with justified text, this plugin gives you an image gallery that completely fills the space you put it in, right up to the left and right margins. Better yet, it does it without cropping or changing the aspect ratios of your images.

## Responsive

RC Gallery looks great on all screen sizes, from phones and tablets up to desktop monitors. It also dynamically resizes as the browser window changes size.

## Easy to use

It's easy to add RC Gallery anywhere on your site, with just a tiny bit of text. It'll automatically create thumbnails for all of the images you include too.

## Optional Built-in Shadowbox

RC Gallery can optionally present images in a simple shadowbox, with minimal styling, or if you prefer, you can use it with whichever other shadowbox plugin you normally use.
